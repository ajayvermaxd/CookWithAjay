**Ingredients:**

For the dumpling wrappers:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup warm water

For the dumpling filling:
- 1/2 cup paneer
- 1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

**For the Dumpling Wrappers:**

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and warm water.
2. Knead the mixture into a smooth and elastic dough. You may need to add a little more water or flour to achieve the right consistency.
3. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.

**For the Dumpling Filling:**

1. In a separate bowl, combine the paneer, chopped cabbage, green onions, minced garlic, minced ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Mix the filling thoroughly until all ingredients are well combined.

**Assembling the Dumplings:**

1. Roll the rested dough into a long cylinder shape.
2. Cut the dough into small, equally sized pieces.
3. Roll each piece into a small, thin circle to form a dumpling wrapper. You can use a rolling pin for this.
4. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each wrapper.
5. Fold the wrapper in half, creating a semi-circle shape.
6. Seal the edges by pressing firmly or by crimping them together. You can use a little water to help seal if needed.
7. Repeat this process for the remaining wrappers and filling.

**Cooking the Dumplings:**

1. To steam the dumplings, you can place them in a bamboo steamer lined with cabbage leaves or parchment paper. Steam for about 15-20 minutes until the dumplings are cooked through.
2. To pan-fry the dumplings, heat a pan with a bit of oil over medium-high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan, ensuring they're not touching each other. Fry until the bottoms are golden brown.
3. For boiled dumplings, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the dumplings and boil until they float to the surface and the wrappers are cooked.

**Serve the dumplings with your favorite dipping sauce,** such as a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar with a touch of chili oil or some soy sauce with minced garlic and ginger. Enjoy your homemade dumplings!
