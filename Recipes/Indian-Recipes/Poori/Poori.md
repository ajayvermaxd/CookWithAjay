To make poori, you will need:

2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
Water, as needed
Vegetable oil, for frying
Instructions:

In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Add water, a little at a time, and mix until the dough comes together.
Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, divide the dough into small balls, each about the size of a golf ball.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball of dough into a thin disc, about 6 inches in diameter.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
Fry the pooris one at a time, for about 1 minute per side, or until they are golden brown and puffed up.
Remove the pooris from the oil and drain them on paper towels.
Serve the pooris hot with your favorite curry or bhaji.
Tips:

For the best results, use whole wheat flour.

If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.

If the dough is too dry, add a little more water.

Roll out the pooris as thin as possible.

Fry the pooris in hot oil, but not too hot, or they will burn.

"Serve the pooris hot immediately for the best flavor."
