**Ingredients for Steamed Rice:**

- 1 cup basmati rice
- 2 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

**Instructions:**

**For Dal Tadka:**

1. Rinse the toor dal (yellow split lentils) under cold water until the water runs clear.

2. In a large pot, combine the washed dal, turmeric powder, salt, and water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.

3. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the dal is soft and fully cooked. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to achieve your desired consistency. You can use a whisk to mash the dal for a smoother texture if desired.

4. In a separate small pan, heat the ghee (or vegetable oil) over medium heat.

5. Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds to the hot ghee. Let them splutter.

6. Add the dried red chilies, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Saut√© until the onion turns golden brown.

7. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.

8. Pour this tempering mixture into the cooked dal and stir to combine.

9. Add chopped cilantro leaves and lemon juice (if using) to the dal. Adjust the salt to taste.

**For Steamed Rice:**

1. Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.

2. In a separate pot, combine the rinsed rice, water, and salt.

3. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15-18 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.

**To Serve:**

- Serve the Dal Tadka hot over steamed rice. You can garnish it with additional cilantro leaves and a dollop of ghee if desired.
