### Recipe Review Process

- Our team of maintainers and recipe reviewers will carefully assess the recipes you submit.
- We will exclusively accept and merge recipes of high quality and verified accuracy into the main repository.

### Branching Guidelines

- Create a new branch for each recipe you are contributing, following this naming pattern:

    ```
    Recipes/Type-Of-Recipes[recipe-name]
    ```
    
- For example:

    ```
    Recipes/Chinese-Recipes/Noodles
    ```

2. **PR Review**: Our maintainers and recipe reviewers will conduct a comprehensive review of your pull request. Following this review, your pull request may either be merged if it meets our standards or, if necessary, we may request specific changes from you.
