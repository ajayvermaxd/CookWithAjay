## Why Git-Based?

Conventional recipe-sharing websites often fall short in providing transparency, facilitating smooth collaboration, and implementing effective version control. This repository steps in to bridge these gaps by harnessing the capabilities of Git and GitHub, offering:

Comprehensive change tracking for absolute transparency.
Streamlined collaboration via features such as forks, branches, and pull requests.
Resilient version control mechanisms to uphold the quality and authenticity of each recipe.
